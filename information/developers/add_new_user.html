<h1>Adding a new user.</h1>

Our NIS servers are listed near the end of /home/mercury/public/hosts.
For more details on how NIS was setup, see the file
<A HREF="http://hydra.cs.mu.oz.au/doc/nis/nis.debian.howto.gz">
nis.debian.howto</A> in
<A HREF="http://hydra.cs.mu.oz.au/doc/nis">/usr/doc/nis</A> on hydra.

<P>

If the new user doesn't already have an account on our departmental machines,
get the departmental sysadmins to add an account for him/her.

Get the new user's existing /etc/passwd entry from a departmental machine,
and then add it to /etc/passwd
on the NIS master server (using adduser or useradd to be safe).
If the NIS master has an /etc/shadow file,
add the user to that file as well.
Make sure that the numerical user ids
are identical to the ones on departmental machines.

<P>

Add the new user to group mercury in /etc/group on the NIS master server
(using vigr to be safe).

<P>

Then execute the following commands as root on the NIS master server to
update the NIS database.

<P>
cd /var/yp<BR>
make<BR>

<P>

Now add a directory on all the /home file systems that we have access to.

<P>

The user should be encouraged to subscribe to the Mercury mailing lists,
and to add themself to the list of people involved in the Mercury project
on the web page (w3/contact/include/people.inc in our CVS repository).
You should also manually add the user to the mercury-local mailing list
by modifying the file mulga:/etc/conf/mail/lists/mercury-local.
