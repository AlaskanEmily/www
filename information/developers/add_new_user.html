<h1>Adding a new user.</h1>

hydra is our master NIS server, with ender being our secondary slave
server, for more details on how NIS was setup, see the file
<A HREF="http://hydra.cs.mu.oz.au/doc/nis/nis.debian.howto.gz">
nis.debian.howto</A> in
<A HREF="http://hydra.cs.mu.oz.au/doc/nis">/usr/doc/nis</A> on hydra.

<P>

Get the new users /etc/passwd entry from mundook and then add it to /etc/passwd
on hydra (using vipw to be safe).

<P>

Add the new user to group mercury in /etc/group on hydra (using vigr to
be safe).

<P>

Then execute the following commands as root on hydra to
update the NIS database.

<P>
cd /var/yp<BR>
make<BR>

<P>

Now add a directory on all the /home file systems that we have access
to.
