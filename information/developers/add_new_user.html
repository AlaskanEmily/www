<h1>Adding a new user.</h1>

hydra is our master NIS server, with ender being our secondary
slave server; for more details on how NIS was setup, see the file
<A HREF="http://hydra.cs.mu.oz.au/doc/nis/nis.debian.howto.gz">
nis.debian.howto</A> in
<A HREF="http://hydra.cs.mu.oz.au/doc/nis">/usr/doc/nis</A> on hydra.

<P>

Get the new users /etc/passwd entry from mundook and then add it to /etc/passwd
on hydra (using vipw to be safe).

<P>

Add the new user to group mercury in /etc/group on hydra (using vigr to
be safe).

<P>

Then execute the following commands as root on hydra to
update the NIS database.

<P>
cd /var/yp<BR>
make<BR>

<P>

Now add a directory on all the /home file systems that we have access
to.

<P>

The user should be encouraged to subscribe to the Mercury mailing lists,
and to add themself to the list of people involved in the Mercury project
on the web page (w3/contact/include/people.inc in our CVS repository).
You should also manually add the user to the mercury-local mailing list
by modifying the file mulga:/etc/conf/mail/lists/mercury-local.
