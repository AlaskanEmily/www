<h2><a name="info">Current Release</a></h2>

Mercury 0.12.1 was released on November 21, 2005.

<h3>Information</h3>

<ul>
<li> <a href = "release-0.12.html">
     Release notes for 0.12.1
     </a>
<li> <a href = "release-0.12-contents.html">
     Contents of release 0.12.1 distribution
     </a>
<li> <a href = "release-0.12-bugs.html">
     Known problems with release 0.12.1
     </a>
<li> <a href = "limitations.html">
     Limitations of the current release.
     </a>
</ul>

<h3>Supported Platforms</h3>

The latest release is known to work on the following platforms:

<p>

<ul>
    <li> x86 machines running Debian Linux 
    <li> x86 machines running SuSE Linux 
    <li> x86 machines running Microsoft Windows XP
    <li> x86 machines running SunOS 5.x
    <li> Apple PowerPC machines running Mac OS 10.3 and above
</ul>

<p>

Mercury should also work on the following platforms, although we have
not tested the latest release on these:

<p>

<ul>
    <li> x86 machines running other versions of Microsoft Windows
         (95, 98, 98SE, ME, NT, 2000)
    <li> x86 machines running other versions of Linux
         (however, there are some known problems with the version of GNU C
	 that shipped with Red Hat Linux 7.0)
    <li> x86 machines running FreeBSD 3.0
    <li> x86 machines running other BSD Unix systems
    <li> PowerPC machines running Linux
    <li> Sun SPARC machines running SunOS 4.x and 5.x
    <li> HP PA machines running HPUX
    <li> IBM RS/6000 machines running AIX
    <li> DEC Mips machines running ULTRIX
    <li> DEC Alpha machines running OSF/1 (Digital Unix)
    <li> DEC Alpha machines running Linux
    <li> SGI Mips machines running IRIX 5.x
</ul>

<p>

It should be pretty easy to port to any sufficiently Unix-like system.

<h3>What do I need?</h3>

<ul>
<li> For Unix systems, you will need the following:<p>
    <ol>
    <li> <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GNU C (gcc)</a>
         <p>
         We recommend GCC 3.4.x.
         <p>
         GCC 3.0, 3.3.1 and 4.0 will NOT work. 
	 They have bugs which cause 
	 internal compiler errors when compiling the C code generated by the 
	 Mercury compiler.
         <p>
         Avoid GCC 2.96 (distributed with Red Hat Linux 7.x) and
         other unofficial releases of GCC.  Also avoid versions of GCC less 
	 than GCC 2.95.X.
         <p>
         It is also possible to use other C compilers, such as
         <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/">lcc</a>,
         but we don't recommend that.
         <p>
    <li> GNU make (version 3.69 or higher).
    </ol>

    <p>

<li> For Windows,<p>
     <ol>
     <li> You will need <a href=http://www.cygwin.com/>Cygwin</a>,
          which you can download
          <a href=http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe>here</a>.
          Cygwin includes GNU C and GNU Make.<p>
     <li> You can optionally use
          <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/default.asp">
          Microsoft Visual C</a> rather than GNU C.<p>
     <li> If you want to take a look at our preliminary support for .NET,
          you also need 
	  <ol>
	      <li> the Microsoft .NET SDK version 1, available from
                   <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/">
		   MSDN</a>.
	           If you are an MSDN Universal subscriber you can
		   also order CDs as part of your subscription.
	      <li> A Windows system suitable for development with
	           Microsoft .NET, such as Windows XP.
	  </ol>
     </ol>
</ul>

<h3><a name="source">Source Distribution</a></h3>

The main "mercury-compiler" source distribution is about 15 Mb.
This includes the compiler, standard library,
debugger, profilers, and other tools.
(Note that this does <em>not</em> include all the sources needed to build
the <a href="<?echo $root?>/download/gcc-backend.html">
native-code back-end</a>; for that you also need the
"mercury-gcc" and "gcc" distributions.
See <a href="<?echo $root?>/download/gcc-backend.html">here</a>
for details.)

<p>

There is also a "mercury-extras" distribution which contains a number
of useful additional libraries.  This is distributed separately,
mainly for copyright reasons (some of the additional libraries do
not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines).
We recommend that everyone who downloads the "compiler"
distribution should also download the "extras" distribution.

<p>

Finally there is also a "mercury-tests" distribution which contains our
test suite.  This may be useful if you are modifying the compiler,
or porting it to a new system.

<dl>
<dt> Compiler (15 Mb)
<dd> 
<? links_to_file("mercury-compiler-0.12.1.tar.gz", "yes") ?>
<p>

<dt> Extras (22 Mb)
<dd>
<? links_to_file("mercury-extras-0.12.1.tar.gz", "no") ?>
<p>

<dt> Tests (914 kb)
<dd>
<? links_to_file("mercury-tests-0.12.1.tar.gz", "no") ?>
</dl>

<h3><a name="binaries">Binary Distribution</a></h3>

Binary packages of the 0.12 release for Linux, Mac OS X (10.3 and 10.4) and 
Windows will be available shortly from this page.
