<h2>Old Releases</h2>

The Mercury distribution has been released to the public several times.
The release information pages for these older releases may contain
useful information, including release notes and known problems,
sometimes with work-arounds or patches.   If you are experiencing
problems with these releases, it might be worth installing the <a
href="release.html">current release</a>
<p>

Please note, however, that the source and binaries for these
releases are often no longer available from the FTP site.

<h3>Release 0.6.2-1</h3>

On the 2nd of June, 1997, Debian GNU/Linux 1.3 was released, including a
slightly modified Mercury 0.6.2 as one of the stable development
packages.  Thanks to Milan Zamazal (pdm@fi.muni.cz) for preparing this
package.  This package can be obtained at any of the Debian mirrors -
see the <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian Web Site</a> for more
information on Debian.  It will also be available on any official Debian
1.3 CDs.  Please note: this Debian version "mercury 0.6.2-1" uses a
different name for the Mercury compiler `mc' due to name clashes with
another package, so the documentation (user's guide in particular)
should read `mercury' instead of `mc'.  This problem will be fixed in
Mercury 0.7.

<h3>Release 0.6.2</h3>

On the 14th of January, 1997 an updated version of the binary
