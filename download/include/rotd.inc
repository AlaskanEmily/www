<h2><a name="info">Release of the day</a></h2>

The latest release of the day is version <b><? echo $rotd_version; ?></b>.
<p>
Please treat ROTDs with caution -- although they are often very
useful and reasonably stable, they are not widely tested, and
may have unfinished features and rough edges.  We are still interested
in feedback and bug reports on the ROTDs.  Please send bug reports to 
<a href="mailto:mercury-bugs@cs.mu.oz.au">mercury-bugs@cs.mu.oz.au</a>.

    <li> x86 machines running Microsoft Windows NT, 2000 or XP.
    <li> x86/x86_64 machines running other versions of Linux
         (however, there are some known problems with the version of GNU C
	 that shipped with Red Hat Linux 7.0)
    <li> x86 machines running FreeBSD 3.0

    <li> DEC Alpha machines running Linux
    <li> SGI Mips machines running IRIX 5.x
</ul>

<p>

<h3>What do I need?</h3>

<ul>
<li> For Unix systems, you will need the following:<p>
    <ol>
    <li> <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GNU C (gcc)</a>
         <p>
         We recommend GCC 3.4.x.
         <p>
         GCC 3.0, 3.3.1 and 4.0 will NOT work. 
	 They have bugs which cause 
	 internal compiler errors when compiling the C code generated by the 
	 Mercury compiler.
         <p>
         Avoid GCC 2.96 (distributed with Red Hat Linux 7.x) and
         other unofficial releases of GCC.  Also avoid versions of GCC less 
	 than GCC 2.95.X.
         <p>
         It is also possible to use other C compilers, such as
         <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/">lcc</a>,
         but we don't recommend that.
         <p>
    <li> GNU make (version 3.69 or higher).
    </ol>

    <p>

<li> For Windows,<p>
     <ol>
     <li> To compiler the source distribution on Windows you 
          will need <a href=http://www.cygwin.com/>Cygwin</a>,
          which you can download
          <a href=http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe>here</a> or
	  <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MSYS</a>. 
          Both Cygwin and MSYS include GNU C and GNU Make.<p>
     <li> You can optionally use
          <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/default.asp">
          Microsoft Visual C</a> rather than GNU C (though Cygwin
	  or MSYS is still required).<p>
     <li> If you want to take a look at our preliminary support for .NET,
          you also need 
	  <ol>
	      <li> the Microsoft .NET SDK version 1, available from
                   <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/">
		   MSDN</a>.
	           If you are an MSDN Universal subscriber you can
		   also order CDs as part of your subscription.
	      <li> A Windows system suitable for development with
	           Microsoft .NET, such as Windows XP.
	  </ol>
     </ol>
</ul>

<p>

<h3><a name="source">Source Distribution</a></h3>

The main "mercury-compiler" source distribution includes the compiler, 
standard library,
debugger, profilers, and other tools.

<p>

There is also a "mercury-extras" distribution which contains a number
of useful additional libraries.  This is distributed separately,
mainly for copyright reasons (some of the additional libraries do
not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines).

<p>

Finally there is also a "mercury-tests" distribution which contains our
test suite.  This may be useful if you are modifying the compiler,
or porting it to a new system.
