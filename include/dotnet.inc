<h3> Mercury on .NET </h3>

<h3> Status </h3>

The most recent daily releases of the Mercury compiler include support
for generating code for the .NET platform.  The Mercury library and
runtime have been partially ported to .NET, however these changed have
not yet been integrated into the Mercury compiler.

<p>

We expect to be able to make a beta-release for the Mercury .NET backend
available in around December 2000.  

<h3> Articles </h3>
