<h3> Mercury on .NET </h3>

<h3> Status </h3>

Recent daily releases of the Mercury compiler include support for
generating code for the .NET platform.  Since early January 2001, they have
also included a partial port of the Mercury library and runtime to .NET.
However, there are still many parts of the standand library which are
not yet implemented for this port.
